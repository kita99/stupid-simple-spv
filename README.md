# Stupid Simple SPV

A stupid simple bitcoin client/lightweight node implemented in python that provides "Simplified Payment Verification" functionality,
according to Satoshi's [paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) (section 8), the purpose of this project is to learn more about the bitcoin protocol,
it is NOT a good idea to use this for anything else than an educational experiment.

This is a messy work in progress, I'm learning as I go so... viewer discretion is advised.
